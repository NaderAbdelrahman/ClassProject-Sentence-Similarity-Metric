# Sentence-Similarity-Metric
Maximum Worst Stretching Factor Using Edit Distance Implemented With Dynamic Programming
Compile using the provided Makefile

How to use:
./ED file1.txt file2.txt

This program takes two files as input, a source file, and a translation of the source.
It will calculate the Edit Distance (using dynamic programming) of every unique sentence pair, in both files.
The program ends with a result of the Max Worst Stretching Factor

Used in Natural Language Processing (NPL) as a metric for sentence similarity
